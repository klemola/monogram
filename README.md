# Monogram

Just a simple monogram of my initials in Elm.

Thanks to Ilona for the idea, and to Ossi for the mathematics.

## I want to try it out!

Sure. You'll need:

- `elm-make`

and optionally for SVG:

- `node`
- `npm`

### Generate HTML "app"

0. `elm-make Main.elm`

Output: `index.html`.

### Generate static SVG file

0. `npm install`
0. `npm run compile`

Output: `monogram.svg`.
